This is my first of many blog posts. I have been a software engineer since way back in 2005. I am currently building React and NodeJs based applications and it's the time for me to start my own blog. If anyone learns something from this â€” about software development, I'll consider it a success.

## Blogging Goals

### Contribute to the Community

I'd like to be a more active participant of the wide and wonderful world of software development! I'd like to have a more interesting and meaningful impact by sharing my knowledge and experience, and that's a big part of why I want to start writing.

### Share My Experience

I've learned so much in the last 17 years ðŸ˜±. How much of it do you think I've written down? Not nearly enough!

I love teaching and talking about software develoment and I've done a fair amount of both and I have found that it is a great way to solidify your understanding of a topic.

I am always learning, by sharing the problems that I face and their solutions and by creating new projects and writing about the process. I hope I can be helpful to other engineers.
